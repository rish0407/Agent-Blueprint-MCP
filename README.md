##  What is Puch AI? How Does It Help?

[Puch AI](https://puch.ai/) is a WhatsApp-based assistant platform that lets you:

- Build, test, and run AI agents conversationally.
- Integrate tools you write locally using **MCP (Modular Custom Protocol)**.
- Call your tool via `/commands` in WhatsAppâ€”no frontend needed.

This repo uses FastMCP to host a custom tool, and exposes it securely to Puch AI via `localtunnel` or `ngrok`. When you send `/mcp connect` in WhatsApp, your MCP tools are now accessible to the Puch agent!

##  Features

-  `onboard_agent`: Generate an AI assistant blueprint from a job description.
-  `validate`: Required for Puch AI to verify your tool.
-  Uses OpenAI securely via `.env`.
-  Powered by FastMCP and securely callable through Puch AI via HTTP tunnel.
